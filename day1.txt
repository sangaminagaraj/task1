Introduction Of HTTP:

             * The Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP.
             * It is used in Client Server Protocol.
             * By using HTTP users send the request to the server and the 
               server send the response to the user

HTTP1:

           * HTTP1 which is created in 1997
           * HTTP is an top-level application protocol
           * It is used to exchange the information between a client
             computer and local(or)remote WEb SERVER.
           * It Works on the textual formate
           * It compress data by itself
           * Each new"TCP"connection requires separate flow control mechanism
              -> "TCP" = It is a connection-oriented protocol for communications that helps in the exchange 
                         of messages between different devices over a network.
           * The header component message however is always sent as plain text.
           * It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
   
HTTP2:

           * HTTP2 which is created in 2015
           * It works on the binary protocol
           * It uses HPACK for data compression
           * HTTP2 was released at google as the significant improvement
             of its predecessor
           * Changes to include features like "multiplexing, header compression,and 
              strean prioritization to minimize page load latency 
           * google announced that it would not provide support for "SPDY" in favor of HTTP2
              -> "SPDY" = Application-layer protocol for transporting content over the 
                          web.It is designed specifically for minimal latency.
          * HTTP2 is able to use single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once 
            so that no one resource blocks any other resources.
         * It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages
