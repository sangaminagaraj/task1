OBJECT REPRESENTATION IN JAVA SCRIPT:

    -> Most Objects contain all their properties in a single block of memory('a' and 'b').All blocks 
       of memory have a pointer bto a map which describes their structure.
 
   -> Objects are more complex and each Object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types
      as well as reference data-types.

Object is JS:
 
    In Java Script, an Object is complex data types that allow you to store and organize data in
Key-value pairs.Object and represent real-world entities and used to model and manipulate information
efficiently,

Creating Object:
 
        'Object' Constructor

  var person={
          
              name: 'sangami', //property
              age:  25, //property
              is employeed : true //property
              };
     Person => Object
   'name','age','is employeed' => Properties   


Object Properties and Methods:  
          
                       Object can contain not only data properties but also methods 

          person.greet=function(){
                          console.log("Welcome to java script");
                         };

               person => Object
               greet  => Method

Internal Representation of Objects:
             * Internally, JavaScript engines represent objects using various data structures. One common 
               representation is the hash table, where keys are hashed to optimize property access.

             * The hash table allows for quick lookup of properties, making object access efficient.

Prototypes and inheritance:

           Java Script is a proto type based language and objects can inherit properties and 
           methods from other Objects through their prototypes.
